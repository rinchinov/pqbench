# pqbench

*lzbench for parquet.*

Measure how well each codec compresses a parquet file and how many on-disk bytes
each column costs.

## Quick start

Docker is the fastest way to try it — no Rust toolchain, no build:

```sh
docker pull pqbench/pqbench:latest
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data:ro" pqbench/pqbench:latest bytemass /data/your.parquet
```

The published image is a portable baseline build; see
[docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for how its numbers compare to a native build.

## Commands

### lz

lzbench-style compression benchmark over raw file bytes:

```sh
pqbench lz file.bin -c zstd@3 --samples 10
```

`--json` emits the same report as composable JSON.

### compression

The same codec sweep over the encoded pages of a **NONE-compressed** parquet
file:

```sh
pqbench compression data.parquet --per-column
```

`--json` emits the same report as composable JSON (the per-column rows are
included when `--per-column` is set).

### bytemass

Per-column byte masses — how many on-disk bytes each column takes per row.
Reads only the footer metadata, so it works on any file regardless of
compression. Multiple paths, quoted glob masks, and storage URIs are
aggregated:

```sh
pqbench bytemass data.parquet
pqbench bytemass 'data/part-*.parquet'
pqbench bytemass s3://bucket/table/part-0.parquet   # requires --features aws
```

`--json` emits a flat per-column JSON table (file/row counts plus one record
per column); `--d3` emits a self-contained HTML treemap:

```sh
pqbench bytemass data.parquet --d3 > treemap.html && xdg-open treemap.html
```

Remote reads fetch the object metadata, the Parquet trailer, and the
serialized footer — never the data pages. `s3://` support is the `aws`
feature; a URI whose backend is not compiled in fails at runtime with the
missing feature named. The library entry point (`bytemass::bytemass`) is
always available and never feature-gated.

### Nested table collections

Analyze tables concurrently while preserving their lake/catalog/schema hierarchy:

```bash
producer | pqbench bytemass --collection - --table-jobs 4 --file-jobs 32 \
  --d3 --output-dir reports
```

Each table carries the existing source document. `--json` emits the same tree
with a result on each table; `--d3` embeds that tree in one HTML page: a layer list plus a clickable
treemap that drills lake layers. See [collections](docs/collections.md) for the input format
and a Databricks CLI → `jq` → pqbench example.

### --source -

A producer that resolves names in a catalog hands pqbench a versioned document
on standard input instead of a path list:

```sh
producer | pqbench bytemass --source -   # inputs name Parquet objects
producer | pqbench delta --source -      # inputs name one Delta table
```

```json
{"kind": "pqbench.remote-source", "version": 1,
 "inputs": ["s3://bucket/table/part-0.parquet"],
 "env": {"AWS_SESSION_TOKEN": "..."}}
```

`env` is optional, accepts only `AWS_*` names, and is applied before the read,
so a catalog that vends expiring credentials can pass them through the pipe
rather than into your shell. pqbench keeps no catalog dependency of its own; the
[Unity Catalog example](docker/e2e-lakehouse/README.md) shows a producer.

### delta

Byte-mass summary of a local Delta table snapshot. Feature-gated — build with
`--features delta` to get the command:

```sh
pqbench delta ./path/to/table
```

Add `--features delta-s3` to resolve and measure Delta tables at `s3://` URIs;
the active files are measured from their footers only.

PRs welcome. The gate is `make check` (`fmt-check` + `clippy -D warnings` +
`test`) and every change must pass it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
